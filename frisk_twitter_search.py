# Coding Challenge
# Implement a twitter search engine that displays tweets containing a
#     user submitted query string.

# For each result tweet,
    # display the name of the person who tweeted it,
    # the content of the tweet,
    # and the number of times it was favored.

# Separate from the list of tweets above,
    # display a sidebar containing a list of hashtags present in the result set
    # along with a count for number of times it was present for each hashtag.

# The UI layout can be kept simple and is entirely up to you.

# Please use Python/Flask along with the Twitter API for this exercise,
# and stick to Python/Flask and code organization/design best practices as much as you can.
